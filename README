The uPSGI project, forked from uWSGI

For official uWSGI documentation check: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Note: The uWSGI project is in maintenance mode (only bugfixes and updates for new languages apis)

This version of the codebase will focus on Perl support only.  Will build supporting documentation over time.
